# SimonPatternGame
Win or get Rickrolled!

The SIMON Pattern game is comprised of an Arduino UNO mounted with a custom PCB shield. To play, you follow the randomly generated pattern until completion. Four possible modes are available. Easy (pattern of 7), hard (pattern of 15), extreme (the pattern changes every time you perform a step with a total of 10 sequence steps), and multiplayer (up to 4 players). Lose and you start again. Win and you hear a fun little tune! Features of this game include:
- 3D printed interlocking case designed using Autodesk Inventor that includes a slot for batteries
- Four different game modes
- Custom etched and soldered PCB shield, designed for maximum playability and spacing
- Code and game layout prototyped on TinkerCAD, further developed with a breadboard and the Arduino IDE
